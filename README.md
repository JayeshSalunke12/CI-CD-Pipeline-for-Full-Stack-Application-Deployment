## üìã Project Workflow

1. **Code Management**  
   - All source code is maintained and version-controlled using **GitHub**.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**  
   - Configured **Jenkins** for automating build, test, and deployment processes.
   - Pipeline triggered on every **code commit** to the GitHub repository.

3. **Containerization and Orchestration**  
   - **Docker** is used to containerize the Angular frontend and Java backend.
   - **Kubernetes** ensures efficient orchestration and scaling of containers.

4. **Cloud Infrastructure**  
   - Deployed on **AWS**, leveraging cloud services for high availability and scalability.

5. **Monitoring and Performance Tracking**  
   - Integrated **Prometheus** for collecting metrics and **Grafana** for real-time visualization and monitoring of system performance.
